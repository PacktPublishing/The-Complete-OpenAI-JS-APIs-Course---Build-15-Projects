## Note on Large Files

This repository contains large files managed by [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/). To ensure these files are downloaded correctly and without corruption, please follow these straightforward steps:

### Instructions to Clone the Repository with GitHub Desktop

1.  **Download and Install GitHub Desktop**:
    
    -   Download and install the GitHub Desktop app from this [link](https://desktop.github.com/?ref_cta=download+desktop&ref_loc=installing+github+desktop&ref_page=docs).
    -   Open the application and sign in with your GitHub credentials.
2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    
    -   In the GitHub Desktop app, navigate to `File` -> `Clone Repository...`.
    -   In the dialog that appears, paste the URL of this repository into the `URL or username/repository` field.
    -   Choose a location on your local drive where you'd like to store the repository files and click `Clone`.
3.  **Open the Cloned Repository**:
    
    -   After the cloning process completes, a confirmation message will appear.
    -   Click `Show in Explorer` (or `Show in Finder` for Mac) to open the folder containing the cloned repository on your computer.
4.  **Access Your Files**:
    
    -   Inside this local repository folder, you will find all the code files. If any files are compressed (zipped), use a tool like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract them.

This method ensures that you get an exact copy of the repository, including all files handled by Git LFS, ready for use on your system.
